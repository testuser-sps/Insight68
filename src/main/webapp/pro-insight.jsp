				<p> Digital transformation is a combination of traditional manufacturing processes, enhanced with new
					advancing
					technologies, working together to drive manufacturing forward and address inefficiencies.
				</p>
				<p>Digital transformation breaks down the information silos of an organization and enables collaboration
					across
					the organization. When the knowledge in your company is unlocked and combined with business
					technologies that

					industrial Internet of Things (IoT), can attack these complex optimization problems in industries
					like
					manufacturing.

					operators.
					Cognitive processes and decision-making will become automated, creating intelligent autonomous
					applications
					within the business.
