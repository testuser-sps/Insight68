					Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") applies to the use of any product,
					service or website provided by us (Insight68), whether we provide
					it directly or use another party to provide it to you (each, a
					"Insight68 Service"). This AUP is designed to ensure compliance
					with the laws and regulations that apply to the Insight68 Service.
					This AUP also protects the interests of all of our clients and
					their customers, as well as our goodwill and reputation. These
					terms are so important that we cannot provide the Insight68 Service
					unless you agree to them. By using the Insight68 Service, you are
					agreeing to these terms. 
				</div>
				<b>1. Reporting Suspected Violations</b><br> <b>
					2. Prohibited Email Actions<br>

				</b> <b>4. Telephone Marketing<br></b><b> 5. No Disruption<br></b><b>
					6. Proper Usage of the Insight68 Service<br>
				</b><b> 7. Restricted Industries<br></b><b> 8. Insight68
					Trademark Use<br>
				</b><b> 9. Developer Terms<br></b><b> 10. General Terms<br></b><br>
				If you are using any Insight68 Service, this AUP applies to you.
				Every client of ours agrees to abide by this AUP and is responsible
				for any violations. You are not allowed to assist or engage others
				in a way that would violate this AUP. We will enforce and ensure
				compliance with this AUP by using methods we consider to be
				appropriate, such as complaint and email failure monitoring.  We may
				also suspend or terminate your use of Insight68 Services pursuant to
				our Customer Terms of Service for violations of this AUP. <br /> <br />
				We periodically update these terms and we will let you know when we
				do through the Notification app in the Insight68 portal used to
				access your Insight68 subscription (if you have one), or by posting
				a revised copy on our website. You agree to review the AUP on a
				regular basis and always remain in compliance.<br /> <br /> <b>1. Reporting
					Suspected Violations</b><br /> <br /> We encourage recipients of
				email messages sent using the Insight68 Service to report
				suspected violations of this AUP to us by forwarding a copy of the
				received email with FULL headers to abuse@Insight68.com. We have a
				policy to investigate all of these reports and to respond in the way
				we consider appropriate. <br /> <br /> If you know of or suspect a

				verifiable permission for the message to be sent. Bulk means that
				the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages that
				have substantively similar content. One-to-one commercial emails are
				spam when they violate CAN-SPAM. One-to-one commercial emails are
				also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending
				that email is in scope of the General Data Protection Regulation
				('GDPR') and you fail to provide notice to individuals and establish
				a lawful basis of processing.<br> <br> You may not use the

				practices in the industry, (d) commercial electronic messages in
				violation of Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (referenced below),
				or (e) in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation
				(GDPR).<br> <br> b. You may not use any misleading or
				false names, addresses, email address, or subject line. <br> <br>
				Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the Insight68 Service
				may not: (a) use or contain invalid or forged headers; (b) use or
				contain invalid or non-existent domain names; (c) employ any
				technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information
				in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path; (d) use
				other means of deceptive addressing; (e) use a third party's
				internet domain name without their consent, or be relayed from or
				through a third party's equipment without the third party's
				permission; (f) contain false or misleading information in the
				subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content; or

				<br /> You agree not to use the Insight68 Service in a way that
				impacts the normal operation, privacy, integrity or security of
				another's property.  Another's property includes another's
				account(s), domain name(s), URL(s), website(s), network(s),
				system(s), facilities, equipment, data, other information, or
				business operations.  You also agree not to use the Insight68
				Service to gain unauthorized access to, use, monitor, make an

					behalf is subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations
					(whether a contractual or statutory duty) with respect to that
					Personal Data.<br> <br> e.<u> Personal Data Breaches.</u>
					Insight68 will notify Customer without undue delay after it becomes
					aware of any Personal Data Breach and shall provide timely
					information relating to the Personal Data Breach as it becomes
					known or reasonably requested by Customer. At Customer's request,
					Insight68 will promptly provide Customer with such reasonable
					assistance as necessary to enable Customer to notify relevant
					Personal Data Breaches to competent authorities and/or affected
					Data Subjects, if Customer is required to do so under Data
					Protection Laws.<br> <br> f. <u>Deletion or Return of
						Personal Data.</u> Insight68 will delete or return all Customer Data,
					including Personal Data (including copies thereof) Processed
					pursuant to this DPA, on termination or expiration of your
					Subscription Service in accordance with the procedures and
					timeframes set out in the Agreement, save that this requirement
					shall not apply to the extent Insight68 is required by applicable
					law to retain some or all of the Customer Data, or to Customer Data
					it has archived on back-up systems, which data Insight68 shall
					securely isolate and protect from any further Processing and delete
					in accordance with its deletion practices. You may request the
					deletion of your Insight68 account after expiration or termination
					of your subscription by sending a request. You may retrieve your
					Customer Data from your account in accordance with our 'Retrieval
					of Customer Data' sections throughout our Product Specific Terms.<br>
					<br> <b>4. Data Subject Requests</b><br />
					<br /> The Subscription Service provides Customer with a number of
					controls that Customer may use to retrieve, correct, delete or
					restrict Personal Data, which Customer may use to assist it in
					connection with its obligations under Data Protection Laws,
					including its obligations relating to responding to requests from
					Data Subjects to exercise their rights under applicable Data
					Protection Laws ("Data Subject Requests"). <br> <br> To
					the extent that Customer is unable to independently address a Data
					Subject Request through the Subscription Service, then upon
					Customer's written request Insight68 shall provide reasonable
					assistance to Customer to respond to any Data Subject Requests or
					requests from data protection authorities relating to the
					Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. Customer shall
					reimburse Insight68 for the commercially reasonable costs arising
					from this assistance.<br> <br> If a Data Subject Request
					or other communication regarding the Processing of Personal Data
					under the Agreement is made directly to Insight68, Insight68 will
					promptly inform Customer and will advise the Data Subject to submit
					their request to Customer. Customer shall be solely responsible for
					responding substantively to any such Data Subject Requests or
					communications involving Personal Data.<br> <br> <b>5.
						Sub-Processors</b><br />
					<br /> Customer agrees that Insight68 may engage Sub-Processors to
					Process Personal Data on Customer's behalf. Insight68 has currently
					appointed, as Sub-Processors, the Insight68 Affiliates and third
					parties listed in Annex 4 to this DPA. Insight68 shall notify
					Customer if it adds or removes Sub-Processors to Annex 4 prior to
					any such changes.<br> <br> Where Insight68 engages
					Sub-Processors, Insight68 will impose data protection terms on the
					Sub-Processors that provide at least the same level of protection
					for Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to
					the nature of the services provided by such Sub-Processors.
					Insight68 will remain responsible for each Sub-Processor's
					compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or
					omissions of such Sub-Processor that cause Insight68 to breach any
					of its obligations under this DPA.<br> <br> <b>6.
						Data Transfers</b><br />
					<br /> Customer acknowledges and agrees that Insight68 may access
					and Process Personal Data on a global basis as necessary to provide
					the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement, and in
					particular that Personal Data will be transferred to and Processed
					by Insight68, Inc. in the United States and to other jurisdictions
					where Insight68 Affiliates and Sub-Processors have operations.
					Insight68 shall ensure such transfers are made in compliance with
					the requirements of Data Protection Laws.<br> <br> <b>7.
						Additional Provisions for European Data</b><br />
					<br /> a. <u>Scope of Section 7. </u>This Section 7 (Additional
					Provisions for European Data) shall apply only with respect to
					European Data.<br> <br> b. <u>Roles of the Parties.</u>
					When Processing European Data in accordance with Customer's
					Instructions, the parties acknowledge and agree that Customer is
					the Controller of European Data and Insight68 is the Processor.<br>
					<br> c.<u> Instructions. </u>If Insight68 believes that an
					Instruction of Customer infringes European Data Protection Laws
					(where applicable), it will inform Customer without delay.<br>
					<br> d.<u> Notification and Objection to New
						Sub-Processors. </u>Insight68 will notify Customer of any changes to
					Sub-processors by updating Annex 4 to this DPA and will give
					Customer the opportunity to object to the engagement of the new
					Sub-Processor on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of
					Personal Data within 30 days after updating Annex 4 to this DPA. If
					Customer does notify Insight68 of such an objection, the parties
					will discuss Customer's concerns in good faith with a view to
					achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such
					resolution can be reached, Insight68 will, at its sole discretion,
					either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit Customer to
					suspend or terminate the affected Subscription Service in
					accordance with the termination provisions of the Agreement without
					liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees
					incurred by Customer prior to suspension or termination).<br>
					<br> e.<u> Data Protection Impact Assessments and
						Consultation with Supervisory Authorities. </u>To the extent that the
					required information is reasonably available to Insight68, and
					Customer does not otherwise have access to the required
					information, Insight68 will provide reasonable assistance to
					Customer with any data protection impact assessments, and prior
					consultations with supervisory authorities or other competent data
					privacy authorities to the extent required by European Data
					Protection Laws.<br> <br> f. <u>Transfer Mechanisms
						for Data Transfers. </u> <br />
					<br />(A) Insight68 shall not transfer European Data to any country
					or recipient not recognized as providing an adequate level of
					protection for Personal Data (within the meaning of European Data
					Protection Law), unless it first takes all such measures as are
					necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with applicable
					European Data Protection Laws. Such measures may include (without
					limitation) transferring such data to a recipient that is
					self-certified to the Privacy Shield, to a recipient that has
					achieved binding corporate rules authorization in accordance with
					European Data Protection Law, or to a recipient that has executed
					appropriate standard contractual clauses adopted or approved by the
					European Commission.<br> <br> (B) Customer acknowledges
					that in connection with the performance of the Subscription
					Services, Insight68, Inc. is a recipient of European Data in the
					United States. The parties agree that Insight68 makes available the
					transfer mechanisms listed below:<br> <br>
					<ul class="legallist">
						&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) 
						<b>Standard Contractual Clauses:</b> Insight68, Inc. agrees to
						abide by and process European Data in compliance with the Standard
						Contractual Clauses, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing
						the parties agree that where the Insight68 contracting entity
						under the Agreement is not Insight68, Inc., such contracting
						entity (not Insight68, Inc.) will remain fully and solely
						responsible and liable to Customer for the performance of the
						Standard Contractual Clauses by Insight68, Inc.  If and to the
						extent the Standard Contractual Clauses (where applicable)
						conflict with any provision of this DPA, the Standard Contractual
						Clauses shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.
						<br>
						<br>
					</ul>
					<ul class="legallist">
						&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) 
						<b>Privacy Shield:</b> For as long as Insight68, Inc. is
						self-certified to the Privacy Shield and to the extent that the
						Standard Contractual Clauses are revoked, or held by a court of
						competent jurisdiction to be invalid the parties acknowledge and
						agree that: (i) Insight68, Inc will be deemed to provide adequate
						protection for European Data (within the meaning of European Data
						Protection Laws) by virtue of having self-certified its compliance
						with Privacy Shield; (ii) Insight68, Inc. shall process European
						Data in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles; and (iii)
						if Insight68, Inc is unable to comply with this requirement,
						Insight68 shall inform Customer.
						<br>
						<br>
					</ul>
					g. <u>Demonstration of Compliance.</u> Insight68 shall make
					available to Customer all information reasonably necessary to

					compliance with this DPA. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it
					shall exercise its audit rights under this DPA by instructing
					Insight68 to comply with the audit measures described in this
					sub-section (g). Customer acknowledges that the Subscription
					Service is hosted by Insight68's data center partners who maintain
					independently validated security programs (including SOC 2 and ISO
					27001) and Insight68's systems are regularly tested by our
					penetration testing process. Upon request, Insight68 shall supply
					(on a confidential basis) a summary copy of its penetration testing
					report(s) to Customer so that Customer can verify Insight68's
					compliance with this DPA.  Further, at Customer's written request,
					Insight68 will provide written responses (on a confidential basis)
					to all reasonable requests for information made by Customer
					necessary to confirm Insight68's compliance with this DPA, provided
					that Customer shall not exercise this right more than once per
					calendar year. <br> <br> <b>8. Additional Provisions
						for California Personal Information</b><br/><br/> a. <u>Scope of
						Section 8.</u> This Section 8 (Additional Provisions for California
					Personal Information) shall apply only with respect to California
					Personal Information.<br> <br> b. <u>Roles of the
						Parties. </u>When processing California Personal Information in
					accordance with Customer's Instructions, the parties acknowledge
					and agree that Customer is a Business and Insight68 is a Service
					Provider for the purposes of the CCPA.<br> <br> c. <u>Responsibilities.</u>
					The parties agree that Insight68 will process California Personal
					Information as a Service Provider strictly for the purpose of
					performing the Subscription Services under the Agreement (the
					"Business Purpose"). Insight68 uses service data for its own
					legitimate Business Purpose as per our Product Privacy Policy. The

					to make any updates and changes to this DPA and the terms that
					apply in Section 9 (a), para. 1 "Amendment; No Waiver" of the
					Agreement shall apply.<br> <br> b.<u> Severability.</u>
					If any individual provisions of this DPA are determined to be
					invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the
					other provisions of this DPA shall not be affected.<br> <br>
					c. <u>Limitation of Liability.</u> Each party and each of their
					Affiliates' liability, taken in aggregate,  arising out of or
					related to this DPA (and any other DPAs between the parties) and

					contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, shall be
					subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability set out in
					the section of the Agreement entitled 'Limitation of Liability' and
					any reference in such section to the liability of a party means
					aggregate liability of that party and all of its Affiliates under
					the Agreement (including this DPA).  For the avoidance of doubt, if
					Insight68, Inc. is not a party to the Agreement, the section of the
					Agreement entitled 'Limitation of Liability' shall apply as between
					Customer and Insight68, Inc., and in such respect any references to
					'Insight68', 'we', 'us' or 'our' shall include both Insight68, Inc.
					and the Insight68 entity that is a party to the Agreement.<br>
					<br> d. <u>Governing Law.</u> This DPA shall be governed by
					and construed in accordance with the governing law and jurisdiction
					provisions in the Agreement, unless required otherwise by Data
					Protection Laws.<br> <br> <b>10. Parties to this DPA</b><br>
					a.<u> Permitted Affiliates.</u> By signing the Agreement, Customer
					enters into this DPA on behalf of itself and, to the extent
					required under applicable Data Protection Laws, in the name and on
					behalf of its Permitted Affiliates, thereby establishing a separate
					DPA between Insight68 and each such Permitted Affiliate subject to
					the Agreement and Sections 9 and 10 of this DPA. Each Permitted
					Affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations under this DPA and,
					to the extent applicable, the Agreement. For the purposes of this

					shall include Customer and such Permitted Affiliates.<br> <br>
					b. <u>Authorization.</u> The legal entity agreeing to this DPA as
					Customer represents that it is authorized to agree to and enter
					into this DPA for and on behalf of itself and, as applicable, each
					of its Permitted Affiliates.<br> <br> c. <u>Remedies.</u>
					Except where applicable Data Protection Laws require a Permitted
					Affiliate to exercise a right or seek any remedy under this DPA
					against Insight68 directly by itself, the parties agree that (i)
					solely the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the
					Agreement shall exercise any right or seek any remedy any Permitted
					Affiliate may have under this DPA on behalf of its Affiliates, and
					(ii) the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the
					Agreement shall exercise any such rights under this DPA not
					separately for each Permitted Affiliate individually but in a
					combined manner for itself and all of its Permitted Affiliates
					together. The Customer entity that is the contracting entity is
					responsible for coordinating all communication with Insight68 under
					the DPA and shall be entitled to make and receive any communication

					<br>d. <u>Other rights.</u> The parties agree that Customer
					shall, when reviewing Insight68's compliance with this DPA pursuant
					to Section 7(g) (Demonstration of Compliance), take all reasonable
					measures to limit any impact on Insight68 and its Affiliates by
					combining several audit requests carried out on behalf of the
					Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement and
					all of its Permitted Affiliates in one single audit.<br> <br>
					<b>Annex 1 - Details of Processing</b><br> This Annex forms
					part of the DPA.<br> <br> <b>A.  Nature and Purpose

					b. Disclosure in accordance with the Agreement (including this DPA)
					and/or as compelled by applicable laws.<br> <b>Annex 2 -
						Security Measures</b><br> This Annex forms part of the DPA.<br>
					Insight68 currently observes the Security Measures described in
					this Annex 2. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein
					shall have the meanings as set forth in the Agreement.<br> <br>
					<b>a) Access Control</b><br> i)  <u>Preventing
						Unauthorized Product Access</u> Outsourced processing: Insight68 hosts
					its Service with outsourced cloud infrastructure providers.
					Additionally, Insight68 maintains contractual relationships with
					vendors in order to provide the Service in accordance with our Data
					Processing Agreement. Insight68 relies on contractual agreements,
					privacy policies, and vendor compliance programs in order to
					protect data processed or stored by these vendors.<br> <br>
					Physical and environmental security: Insight68 hosts its product
					infrastructure with multi-tenant, outsourced infrastructure
					providers. The physical and environmental security controls are
					audited for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance, among other
					certifications.<br> <br> Authentication: Insight68
					implemented a uniform password policy for its customer products.
					Customers who interact with the products via the user interface
					must authenticate before accessing non-public customer data.<br>
					<br> Authorization: Customer Data is stored in multi-tenant
					storage systems accessible to Customers via only application user
					interfaces and application programming interfaces. Customers are
					not allowed direct access to the underlying application
					infrastructure. The authorization model in each of Insight68's
					products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned
					individuals can access relevant features, views, and customization
					options. Authorization to data sets is performed through validating
					the user's permissions against the attributes associated with each
					data set.<br> <br> Application Programming Interface
					(API) access: Public product APIs may be accessed using an API key
					or through Oauth authorization.<br> <br> ii) <u> Preventing
						Unauthorized Product Use</u> Insight68 implements industry standard
					access controls and detection capabilities for the internal
					networks that support its products.<br> <br> Access
					controls: Network access control mechanisms are designed to prevent
					network traffic using unauthorized protocols from reaching the
					product infrastructure. The technical measures implemented differ
					between infrastructure providers and include Virtual Private Cloud
					(VPC) implementations, security group assignment, and traditional
					firewall rules.<br> <br> Intrusion detection and
					prevention: Insight68 implemented a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
					solution to protect hosted customer websites and other
					internet-accessible applications. The WAF is designed to identify
					and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.<br>
					<br> Static code analysis: Security reviews of code stored in
					Insight68's source code repositories is performed, checking for
					coding best practices and identifiable software flaws.<br> <br>
					Penetration testing: Insight68 performs standard industry
					recognized penetration tests. The intent of the penetration tests
					is to identify and resolve foreseeable attack vectors and potential
					abuse scenarios.<br> <br> iii)   <u>Limitations of
						Privilege & Authorization Requirements</u> Product access: A subset of
					Insight68's employees have access to the products and to customer
					data via controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a
					subset of employees is to provide effective customer support, to
					troubleshoot potential problems, to detect and respond to security
					incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through
					"just in time" requests for access; all such requests are logged.
					Employees are granted access by role. <br> <br> All
					employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent
					with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical
					standards.<br> <br> <b>b) Transmission Control</b><br>
					In-transit: Insight68 makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as
					SSL or TLS) available on every one of its login interfaces and for
					free on every customer site hosted on the Insight68 products.
					Insight68's HTTPS implementation uses industry standard algorithms
					and certificates.<br> <br> At-rest: Insight68 stores user
					passwords following policies that follow industry standard
					practices for security.  Insight68 has implemented technologies to
					ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest. <br> <br> <b>c)
						Input Control</b><br> Detection: Insight68 designed its
					infrastructure to log extensive information about the system
					behavior, traffic received, system authentication, and other
					application requests. Internal systems aggregated log data and
					alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous
					activities. Insight68 personnel, including security, operations,
					and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.<br>
					<br> Response and tracking: Insight68 maintain records of
					known security incidents that includes description, dates and times
					of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and
					confirmed security incidents are investigated by security,
					operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution steps
					are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents,
					Insight68 will take appropriate steps to minimize product and
					Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to
					Customer will be in accordance with the terms of the DPA or
					Agreement. <br> <br> <b>d) Availability Control</b><br>
					Infrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use
					commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a minimum of 99.95%
					uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to
					power, network, and HVAC services.<br> <br> Fault
					tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure
					redundancy and fail-over protections during a significant
					processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable
					data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.<br>
					<br> Online replicas and backups: Where feasible, production
					databases are designed to replicate data between no less than 1
					primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and
					maintained using at least industry standard methods.<br> <br>
					Insight68's products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless
					failover. The server instances that support the products are also
					architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This
					design assists Insight68 operations in maintaining and updating the
					product applications and backend while limiting downtime.<br>
					<br> <b>Annex 3 - Standard Contractual Clauses</b><br>
					For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the

					(j) that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).<br>
					<br> <b>Clause 5</b><br> <b>Obligations of the data
						importer</b><br> The data importer agrees and warrants:<br>
					(a) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data
					exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses;

					transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;<br> <br>
					(b) that it has no reason to believe that the legislation
					applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions
					received from the data exporter and its obligations under the
					contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation
					which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the
					warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will
					promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is
					aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the

					law enforcement investigation;<br> <br> (ii) any
					accidental or unauthorized access; and<br> <br> (iii) any
					request received directly from the data subjects without responding
					to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorized to do so;<br>
					<br> (e) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from
					the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data
					subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the
					supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data
					transferred;<br> <br> (f) at the request of the data
					exporter to submit its data-processing facilities for audit of the
					processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried
					out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of
					independent members and in possession of the required professional
					qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the
					data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory
					authority;<br> <br> (g) to make available to the data
					subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing
					contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain
					commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial
					information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be
					replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those
					cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the
					data exporter;<br> <br> (h) that, in the event of
					subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and
					obtained its prior written consent;<br> <br> (i) that the
					processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in
					accordance with Clause 11;<br> <br> (j) to send promptly
					a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses
					to the data exporter.<br> <br> <b>Clause 6</b><br> <b>Liability</b><br>
					1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage
					as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause
					3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to
					receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage
					suffered.<br> <br> 2. If a data subject is not able to
					bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1
					against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data
					importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred
					to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has
					factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become
					insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue
					a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter,
					unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal
					obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of
					law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against
					such entity. The data importer may not rely on a breach by a
					subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own
					liabilities.<br> <br> 3. If a data subject is not able to
					bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer
					referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the
					subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or
					in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer
					have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become
					insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue
					a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own
					processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data
					exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has
					assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data
					importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data
					subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability
					of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing
					operations under the Clauses.<br> <br> <b>Clause 7</b><br>
					<b>Mediation and jurisdiction</b><br> 1. The data importer
					agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party
					beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the
					Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data
					subject:<br> <br> (a)  to refer the dispute to mediation,
					by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory
					authority;<br> (b)  to refer the dispute to the courts in the
					Member State in which the data exporter is established.<br> 2.
					The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not
					prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in
					accordance with other provisions of national or international law.<br>
					<br> <b>Clause 8</b><br> <b>Cooperation with
						supervisory authorities</b><br> 1. The data exporter agrees to
					deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if
					it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable
					data protection law.<br> <br> 2. The parties agree that
					the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the
					data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope
					and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of
					the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.<br>
					<br> 3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data
					exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any
					subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data
					importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a
					case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures
					foreseen in Clause 5(b).<br> <br> <b>Clause 9</b><br>
					<b>Governing law</b><br> The Clauses shall be governed by the
					law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.<br>
					<br> <b>Clause 10</b><br> <b>Variation of the
						contract</b><br> The parties undertake not to vary or modify the
					Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on
					business related issues where required as long as they do not
					contradict the Clause.<br> <br> <b>Clause 11</b><br>
					<b>Subprocessing</b><br> 1. The data importer shall not
					subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of
					the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written
					consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts
					its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data
					exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with
					the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the
					subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses.
					Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection
					obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall
					remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the
					subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.<br> <br>
					2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the
					subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary
					clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is
					not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in
					paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data
					importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to
					exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has
					assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data
					importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party
					liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own
					processing operations under the Clauses.<br> <br> 3. The
					provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of
					the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the
					law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.<br>
					<br> 4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing
					agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data
					importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least
					once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's
					data protection supervisory authority.<br> <br> <b>Clause
						12</b><br> <b>Obligation after the termination of personal
						data-processing services</b><br> 1. The parties agree that on the
					termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data
					importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data
					exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies
					thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data
					and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless
					legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from
					returning or destroying all or part of the personal data
					transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will
					guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and
					will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.<br>
					<br> 2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that
					upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory
					authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an
					audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.<br> <br>
					<b>Appendix 1 to the Standard Contractual Clauses</b><br> This

					For the purposes of this Appendix, "DPA" means the Data Processing
					Agreement in place between Customer and Insight68 and to which
					these Clauses are incorporated and "Agreement" shall have the
					meaning given to it in the DPA. <br> <br> <b>Clause
						4(h) and 8: Disclosure of these Clauses </b><br>  a. Data
					exporter agrees that these Clauses constitute data importer's
					Confidential Information as that term is defined in the Agreement
					and may not be disclosed by data exporter to any third party
					without data importer's prior written consent unless permitted
					pursuant to Agreement.  This shall not prevent disclosure of these
					Clauses to a data subject pursuant to Clause 4(h) or a supervisory
					authority pursuant to Clause 8.<br> <br> <b>Clause
						5(a): Suspension of data transfers and termination</b><br> a. The
					parties acknowledge that data importer may process the personal

					instructions as provided by the data exporter and the Clauses.<br>
					<br> b. The parties acknowledge that if data importer cannot

					promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which
					case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data
					and/or terminate the contract.<br> <br> c. If the data
					exporter intends to suspend the transfer of personal data and/or
					terminate these Clauses, it shall endeavor to provide notice to the
					data importer and provide data importer with a reasonable period of
					time to cure the non-compliance ("Cure Period"). <br> <br>
					d. If after the Cure Period the data importer has not or cannot
					cure the non-compliance then the data exporter may suspend or
					terminate the transfer of personal data immediately.  The data
					exporter shall not be required to provide such notice in instance
					where it considers there is a material risk of harm to data
					subjects or their personal data.<br> <br> <b>Clause
						5(f): Audit</b><br> a. Data exporter acknowledges and agrees that
					it exercises its audit right under Clause 5(f) by instructing data

					<b>Clause 5(j): Disclosure of subprocessor agreements</b><br> 
					a. The parties acknowledge the obligation of the data importer to

					disclosing onward subprocessor agreements to data exporter. 
					Notwithstanding this, data importer shall use reasonable efforts to
					require any subprocessor it appoints to permit it to disclose the
					subprocessor agreement to data exporter.<br> <br> c. Even
					where data importer cannot disclose a subprocessor agreement to
					data exporter, the parties agree that, upon the request of data
					exporter, data importer shall (on a confidential basis) provide all
					information it reasonably requires in connection with such
					subprocessing agreement to data exporter. <br> <br> <b>Clause
						6: Liability</b><br>  a. Any claims brought under the Clauses

					<b>APPENDIX 1</b><br> <b>ADDITIONAL COVERAGE TERMS</b><br>
					If your Total Committed Subscription Value exceeds seventy-five
					thousand U.S. dollars (USD$75,000), then these Additional Coverage
					Terms apply.  If, at any point during your Subscription Term, your
					Total Committed Subscription Value is below this amount, then these
					terms will not apply. These terms amend the Customer Terms of
					Service and will control in the event of a conflict with the
					Customer Terms of Service. We may update or change these terms in
					the same way as we can our Customer Terms of Service, as we
					describe in the 'Amendment; No Waiver' section of our Customer
					Terms of Service. <br> <br> <b>1. Insight68
						Indemnification</b><br> We will indemnify, defend and hold you
					harmless, at our expense, against any Action (as defined in this
					section) brought against you (and its officers, directors,
					employees, agents, service providers, licensors, and affiliates) by
					a third party not affiliated with you to the extent that such
					Action is based upon or arises out of 1) an allegation that the
					Subscription Service infringes a valid patent in a member state of
					the Patent Cooperation Treaty, registered trademark, or copyright
					("IP Indemnification"), or 2) our breach of our confidentiality
					obligations or our use of Customer Data in violation of this
					Agreement ("Confidentiality and Data Misuse Indemnification"). <br>
					<br> You will: notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of
					Customer becoming aware of any such claim; give us sole control of
					the defense or settlement of such a claim; and provide us (at our
					expense) with any and all information and assistance reasonably
					requested by us to handle the defense or settlement of the claim.
					We shall not accept any settlement that (i) imposes an obligation
					on you; (ii) requires you to make an admission; or (iii) imposes
					liability not covered by these indemnifications or places
					restrictions on you without your prior written consent.   <br>
					<br> We shall not have any obligation or liability under this
					subsection if the alleged claim is caused by or based on: (i) any
					combination of the Subscription Service with any hardware,
					software, equipment, or data not provided by us, (ii) modification
					of the Subscription Service by anyone other than us, or
					modification of the Subscription Service by us in accordance with
					specifications or instructions that Customer provided, (iii) use of
					the Subscription Service in violation of or outside the scope of
					this Agreement, (iv) an allegation that the Subscription Service
					consists of a function, system or method traditionally utilized in
					marketing or sales software or services that is not commercially
					unique to the Subscription Service, and the commercially unique
					aspects of the Subscription Service are not identified in the
					allegation giving rise to the claim, or (v) user interface or
					related user design elements not provided by us. <br> <br>
					Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of such a claim, or if
					we believe that such a claim is likely, we may, at our sole option
					and expense: (a) modify the Subscription Service or provide
					Customer with substitute Subscription Service that is
					non-infringing; or (b) obtain a license or permission for Customer
					to continue to use the Subscription Service, at no additional cost
					to Customer; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is, in our judgment,
					commercially practicable, terminate Customer's access to the
					Subscription Service (or to a portion of the Subscription Service
					as necessary to resolve the claimed infringement) and refund all or
					a proportionate amount of any fees that Customer has previously
					paid covering use of the Subscription Service after the effective
					date of such termination. THIS SUBSECTION STATES OUR ENTIRE
					LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO
					ANY CLAIM PROVIDED FOR UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH.<br> <br> <b>2. Performance
						Warranty</b><br> Notwithstanding anything contained in the
					'Disclaimer of Warranties' section of the Insight68 Customer Terms
					of Service, we warrant that: (i) the Subscription Service and
					Consulting Services will be provided in a manner consistent with
					generally accepted industry standards, and (ii) we shall not
					knowingly introduce any viruses or other forms of malicious code
					into the Subscription Service.<br> <br> <b>3. Limitation
						of Liability</b><br> The 'Limitation of Liability' sub-section in
					the 'Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability' section of the Customer
					Terms of Service is revised to read as follows: <br> <br>
					"EXCEPT FOR YOUR LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT OF FEES, YOUR LIABILITY
					ARISING FROM YOUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 'INDEMNIFICATION' SECTION,
					OUR IP INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 'INSIGHT68
					INDEMNIFICATION' SECTION AND YOUR LIABILITY FOR VIOLATION OF OUR
					INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE OTHER TERMS
					OF THIS AGREEMENT, EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES IS DETERMINED TO
					HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY THIRD
					PARTY, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF A PARTY
					AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIMITED TO A SUM EQUAL TO THE TOTAL
					AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE IN THE TWELVE
					MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM".<br>
					<br> <b>APPENDIX 2</b><br> <b>U.S. GOVERNMENT
						CUSTOMER ADDITIONAL TERMS</b><br> If you are a U.S. local, state
					or federal government entity that uses the Insight68 products or
					services (a "Government Customer"), then these Insight68 Government

					Terms of Service and will control in the event of a conflict with
					the Customer Terms of Service. We may update or change these terms
					in the same way as we can our Customer Terms of Service as we

					<br> <b>4.  Contracting Entity and Applicable Law</b><br>
					The 'Contracting Entity and Applicable Law' section of the Customer
					Terms of Service is revised to read as follows:<br> <br>
					You are contracting with Insight68, Inc. and this Agreement is
					governed by the laws applicable to you as a Government Customer, or

					This Product Privacy Policy does not apply to any information or
					data collected by Insight68 as a controller for other purposes,
					such as information collected on our websites or through other
					channels for marketing purposes.<br> <br> Insight68
					processes Customer Data under the direction of our Customers, and

					disclosure, and/or obtaining consent prior to transferring the

						Use of the Subscription Service</b><br> <br> <b>A. The
						Insight68 Subscription Service</b><br> Our online Subscription
					Service allows users (typically small to medium size businesses) to
					create and share marketing, sales and customer service content. The
					Subscription Service can also be used to help organize sales data
					about a company's sales pipeline (e.g., leads, customers, deals,
					etc.). The information added to the Subscription Service, either by
					site visitors providing their contact information or when a
					Subscription Service user adds the information, is stored and
					managed on our service providers' servers. Insight68 provides the
					Subscription Service to our customers for their own marketing,
					sales, CRM, and customer service needs.<br> <br> <b>B.
						Use By Our Customers</b><br> Our customers use the Subscription
					Service to build webpages that people can visit to learn more about
					their business. When customers use the Subscription Service, they
					may collect Personal Data such as first and last name, email
					address, physical address, or phone number. Insight68 does not
					control the content of these webpages or the types of Personal Data
					that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the
					Subscription Service. That Personal Data is controlled by them and
					is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy
					policies. Insight68 processes our customers' information as they
					direct and in accordance with our agreements with our customers,
					and we store it on our service providers' servers.<br> Our
					agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that
					information, except as necessary to provide and improve the
					Subscription Service, as permitted by this Product Privacy Policy,
					and as required by law.<br> We have no direct relationship
					with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers.
					Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting
					or updating information they have collected from using the
					Subscription Service. We may work with our customers to help them
					provide notice to their visitors about their data collection,
					processing and usage.<br> <br> <b>2. How we Share
						Information we Collect</b><br> <br> <b>A. With Service
						Providers</b><br> <br> We employ other third-party service
					providers to provide services on our behalf to visitors to our
					websites, our customers, and Users of the Subscription Service and
					may need to share your information with them to provide
					information, products or services to you. Examples may include
					analyzing data or performing statistical analysis, processing
					credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us
					in order to provide you with better service, and providing customer
					service or support. These service providers are prohibited from
					using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are
					required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In
					all cases where we share your information with such agents, we
					explicitly require the agent to acknowledge and adhere to our
					privacy and customer data handling policies.<br> <br> <b>B.
						Due to Corporate Events</b><br> <br> If we (or our assets)
					are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition,
					bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information
					gathered by Insight68 on the websites and the Subscription Service.
					In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent
					notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your
					Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding your Personal
					Data.<br> <br> <b>C. In accordance with Compelled
						Disclosure</b><br> <br> We reserve the right to use or
					disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably
					believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights,
					protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or
					comply with a law, court order, or legal process.<br> <br>

					data, access times, and referring website addresses. We use this

					Service and for security purposes. We may link log files to
					Personal Data such as name, email address, address, and phone
					number for these purposes.<br> <br> <u>iii.

					account. If you give an integration provider access to your
					Insight68 account then your use of these integrations is subject to
					the service terms and privacy terms made available by that
					integrator. We are not responsible for third party integrators and
					in no case are such integration providers our sub-processors.<br>

					are a customer, prospect, or otherwise interact with one of our
					Customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our
					customers that use our Subscription Service, please contact the
					customer that you interact with directly. If you want to access,
					correct, amend, or delete data controlled by a Insight68 customer,
					you should direct your query to the Insight68 Customer (the data
					controller). We will work with customers to respond to data subject
					requests as outlined in our DPA.<br> <br> You may request
					the deletion of your Insight68 account or Subscription Service by
					sending an email request.  You should also review our DPA to
					understand our obligations as a processor of your data and how we
					comply with relevant data protection laws.<br> <br> If
					you are seeking to exercise your data subject access rights for the
					data Insight68 processes as a controller, please see this Privacy
					Policy.<br> <br> <b>5. Data Retention</b><br> <br>

					retained for as long as you have a paid Subscription and/or remain
					an active customer in your portal. Your data is deleted upon your

					termination of all customer agreements. In general, Customer Data
					is deleted after your paid Subscription ends and your portal

					service provider failures outside of our datacenter as measured by

					Service Uptime falls below 99.95% in a given calendar month,
					Customer will be entitled to receive a credit equal to the
					pro-rated amount of fees applicable to the downtime as measured
					within two (2) or more consecutive calendar months during which the
					Service Uptime fell below 99.95%, which credit shall be applied
					against an invoice or charge for the following renewal Subscription
